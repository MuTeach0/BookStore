BookShoppingCartMvc (A basic e-comm system for beginners)📚🛒
Build a Full E-commerce Application Using .NET Core 9, SQL Server, MVC . Initially it was designed to explain how shopping cart 🛒 works in dot net core mvc. But now it has more features except payment gateway. A ⭐ in repository is highly appreciated, helps to promote my content.

📢 Initially , this project was built with .net 7. But it is Upgraded to .net 9.0. now and I will try to keep it up to date.

Tech stack 🧑‍💻
Dotnet core mvc (.Net 9)
MS SQLServer 2022 (Database)
Entity Framework Core (ORM)
Identity Core (Authentication)
Bootstrap 5 (frontend)
Tools I have used and their alternative
Visual Studio 2022 (Alternatives : .NET SDK + VS Code or .NET SDK + JetBrains Rider).
Microsoft Sql Server Management Studio (Alternative : mssql extension for vscode / dbeaver).
Instead of manually installing sql server, you can also used sql server which is spun up in docker.
Note: Every tool and tech is free for personal use.
